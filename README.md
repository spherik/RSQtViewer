# RSQtViewer
Qt simple viewer for Intel RealSense

## Dependencies
* [Qt](http://qt-project.org/)
* [Intel RealSense SDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-realsense-sdk)

  **WARNING**: The SDK should be installed in a path **without spaces** (*C:\ProgramFiles (x86)* is a bad path, as it contains spaces. I recomend installing the SDK in *C:\Intel\*)
